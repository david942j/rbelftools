  # The relocations a file packs into a bitmap instead of recording one by one.
  #
  # Almost every relocation of a file that is loaded anywhere only adds the
  # load bias to a word, which takes an entry recording an address, a type that
  # is the same every time, and an addend that repeats what the word already
  # holds. A file may pack them instead, as a run of addresses in ascending
  # order, and spend a bit rather than an entry on each.
  #
  # An even entry is an address, and relocates the word there. An odd entry is
  # a bitmap of the words following the last address, a set bit relocating one
  # of them. Nothing records a type, because every relocation here is the one
  # {ELFTools::Constants::R.relative} names.
